  education1: I am a research associate in computational neuroscience with experience in complex networks, comparative neuroanatomy and cell culturing. In the Active Touch Lab I am helping people walk again by modelling the tactile responses of the foot sole aiming at real-time feedback prosthetics! In addition to that, I am a member of INSIGNEO and a data scientist for the AMRC at the University of Sheffield. My research interests include general intelligence, network neuroscience and information processing in the somatosensory cortex.
