  education1: I am a research associate in computational neuroscience with experience in complex networks, comparative neuroanatomy and cell culturing. In the Active Touch Lab I am helping people walk again by modelling the tactile responses of the foot sole aiming at real-time feedback prosthetics! In addition to that, I am a member of INSIGNEO and a data scientist for the AMRC at the University of Sheffield. My research interests include general intelligence, network neuroscience and information processing in the somatosensory cortex.

  education1: Dr Nicolas Thorne received his Bsc in Cognitive Systems from the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada and his Msc in Cybernetics from Reading University. His PhD degree was under Prof. Nasuto, Dr. Hayashi and Dr. Honisch (SPCLS). His work focuses on modelling how humans are able to communicate with each other through touch in order to complete a task. High density EEG data will be taken of each pair of participants and analyzed to find the large-scale neural networks that characterize the different states that can be observed during the experiment.

  education1: I am a fourth year BSc student at the federal university of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). I've just finished my dissertation on the differences between motor imagery and motor execution, through electroencephalography (EEG) analysis. Also, I am going to the University of Sheffield to do a 2 months project supervised by Dr.Rodrigo Kazu.
