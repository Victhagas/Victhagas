- title: "Selective pruning and neuronal death generate heavy-tail network connectivity"
  image: paper1.png
  description: From the proliferative mechanisms that generate neurons from a seed population of progenitor cells, through neuron migration and the formation of synaptic connections, several vicissitudes culminate in the formation of a functional mature brain. Component loss, just as gain, remains ubiquitous throughout and can be substantial in scale. For instance, over healthy development, rodent brains lose over half the number of their original neuronal cells and synapses. However, the role of deleterious steps in network ontology (adaptive or otherwise) remains elusive. On the grounds of parsimony alone, it is unlikely that such a costly process would play no role in refining brain network architecture, or that the pruned components are lost at random. Like in the case of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, we expect the processes of synaptic and neuron pruning to also have been shaped by evolution to enable complex and efficient computations. Inspired by the evident necessity of incorporating both component loss and gain in any complete description of a real neuronal network, we propose here a simple algorithm in which a directed network evolves through the selective deletion of less-connected nodes ('neurons') and edges ('synapses'). We show that the resulting networks robustly and without fine-tuning display scale-invariant degree distributions, as long as the network is predominantly feed-forward in nature. Scale-invariance has several properties that are desirable in biological networks, they are by construction scalable, resistant to damage by random deletions, and strongly connected while parsimonious in wiring. Although our algorithm is not meant to be a realistic model for the formation of biological neuronal networks, our results strongly suggest that neuronal and synaptic losses during development are selective rather than random and that selective deletion is an adaptive mechanism that plays a role in producing efficiently structured networks. Finally, despite being inspired by biology, our results have implications for network science more broadly. Scale invariance in degree distributions was first demonstrated for growing preferential attachment networks and then shown empirically to be present in a broad range of contexts. Our algorithm for preferential detachment provides an alternative mechanism for generating such networks, indicating perhaps that both preferential attachment and detachment are part of a broader class of algorithms that result in scale-free networks.

- title: "Modeling foot sole cutaneous afferents: FootSim"
  image: paper1.jpg
  description: Here, We developed the FootSim model, a realistic replication of mechanoreceptor activation in the lower limb. The model simulates neural spiking responses to arbitrary mechanical stimuli from the combined population of all four types of mechanoreceptors innervating the foot sole. It considers specific mechanics of the foot sole skin tissue, and model internal parameters are fitted using human microneurography recording dataset.

- title: "Cellular scaling rules for the brain of Artiodactyla include a highly folded cortex with few neurons"
  image: paper2.jpg
  description: Here, we suggest that the scaling rules found to be shared across modern afrotherians, glires, and artiodactyls applied to the common Eutherian ancestor, such as the relationship between the mass of the cerebral cortex as a whole and its number of neurons. Our results, show that the distribution of neurons along the surface of the cerebral cortex, which is related to its degree of gyrification, appears to be a clade-specific characteristic.

- title: "White matter volume and white/gray matter ratio in mammalian species as a consequence of the universal scaling of cortical folding"
  image: paper3.jpeg
  description: Here, we postulate that the relative white matter volume is determined as the developing cortex settles in the most energetically favorable folded conformation, regardless of its number of neurons.

- title: "Three-dimensional computational modelling technique and its application in paleontology"
  image: paper4.jpg
  description: The three-dimensional computer modelling consists in acquiring of linear measurements or images of an object, through different methodologies, and the subsequent data insertion in software modeling programs. The acquisition of data can be accomplished through manual measurement of the object dimensions or through photogrammetry, with or without calibration base, videogrammetry with laser trace and webcam, white light projection, 3D laser-scanners (hand and table), and tomography. In paleontology 3D modeling may serve as a tool in works involving morphological and biomechanical studies, in the precise calculation of corporal mass, center of mass observation, volume and posture, and in studies of myological and tissue formation. It also enables structural corrections, simulation of living organisms, and it serves as a tool for disseminate scientifi c works. In this study, several fossil images was captured and tested in distinct 3D modeling methods to evaluate resolution, operating effi ciency, and advantages of its application on paleontological studies. Videogrammetry with laser trace and webcam proved to be the most economic methodology, while videogrammetry with white light projection was the most precise and accurate, being specifi cally helpful on small samples. Some application examples are also presented.
