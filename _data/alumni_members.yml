  education1: I studied Cognitive Science at the University of Osnabrück, Germany. After an internship at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), I obtained an MSc and PhD in Neuroinformatics at the University of Edinburgh. I was then a postdoctoral scholar in Sliman Bensmaia’s lab at the University of Chicago, before joining the University of Sheffield to set up my own lab. For most of my career I have worked on the sense of touch, using methods from computational neuroscience, robotics, and machine learning.

  education1: Diego is a Research Assistant Professor at the University of Pittsburgh. He received his undergraduate degree in Biomedical Sciences from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) and continued in his Ph.D. program at UFRJ (mentored by Roberto Lent and Fernanda Tovar-Moll) and as a pre-doc student at NIH (mentored by Afonso Silva) studying the neuroplasticity in different diseases, especially the dysgenesis of the Corpus Callosum with neuronal tracing and multimodal MRI techniques. Currently, he continues his research at the University of Pittsburgh (mentored by Afonso Silva) on brain connectivity in health and diseased brains, and how the altered structure can affect the brain function in mice, marmosets and humans.
