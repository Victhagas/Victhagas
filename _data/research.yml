  description: From the proliferative mechanisms that generate neurons from a seed population of progenitor cells, through neuron migration and the formation of synaptic connections, several vicissitudes culminate in the formation of a functional mature brain. Component loss, just as gain, remains ubiquitous throughout and can be substantial in scale. For instance, over healthy development, rodent brains lose over half the number of their original neuronal cells and synapses. However, the role of deleterious steps in network ontology (adaptive or otherwise) remains elusive. On the grounds of parsimony alone, it is unlikely that such a costly process would play no role in refining brain network architecture, or that the pruned components are lost at random. Like in the case of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, we expect the processes of synaptic and neuron pruning to also have been shaped by evolution to enable complex and efficient computations. Inspired by the evident necessity of incorporating both component loss and gain in any complete description of a real neuronal network, we propose here a simple algorithm in which a directed network evolves through the selective deletion of less-connected nodes ('neurons') and edges ('synapses'). We show that the resulting networks robustly and without fine-tuning display scale-invariant degree distributions, as long as the network is predominantly feed-forward in nature. Scale-invariance has several properties that are desirable in biological networks, they are by construction scalable, resistant to damage by random deletions, and strongly connected while parsimonious in wiring. Although our algorithm is not meant to be a realistic model for the formation of biological neuronal networks, our results strongly suggest that neuronal and synaptic losses during development are selective rather than random and that selective deletion is an adaptive mechanism that plays a role in producing efficiently structured networks. Finally, despite being inspired by biology, our results have implications for network science more broadly. Scale invariance in degree distributions was first demonstrated for growing preferential attachment networks and then shown empirically to be present in a broad range of contexts. Our algorithm for preferential detachment provides an alternative mechanism for generating such networks, indicating perhaps that both preferential attachment and detachment are part of a broader class of algorithms that result in scale-free networks.

- title: "An intelligent classificator for the diagnosis of dysgenesis"
  image: paper2.jpg
  description: Corpus Callosum Dysgenesis (CCD) is a congenital developmental malformation of the corpus callosum (CC) often associated with several comorbidities. Callosal malformations vary extensively in their presentation, from hypoplasic and partial formations to complete agenesis. Regardless of the degree of callosal malformations, reorganization of the CCD brain can generate new aberrant white matter fibre bundles, leading to widespread structural and functional changes affecting the entire brain. For example, hypoplasic CCD subjects and mouse models have an atypical structural brain connectivity profile that is substantially different from that of healthy subjects. To better understand how CCD brains can rewire to compensate for callosal deficits and process interhemispheric information, animal models are needed to allow more invasive studies aiming to describe axonal plasticity. Many genetically modified mice lines have been described to feature CCD, but most do not survive until adult age. In addition, they do not present hypoplasia or partial CCD, only complete agenesis. Other spontaneous mouse strains, such as the Balb/c, can produce different CCD phenotypes and fill the void. However, accessing cognitive behavior in mice is challenging. Because they are phylogenetically closer to humans and exhibit complex cognitive functions and social behavior, non-human primates are the ideal model of CCD. One great example is the common marmoset, a highly social non-human primate that has several practical advantages in biomedical research, such as small size, easy adaptation to life in captivity, no zoonotic transmission, and prolific breeding. Marmosets exhibit a highly sophisticated repertoire of social behavior, including cooperative rearing of infants, foraging for food and vigilance against predators, social grooming, scent-marking behavior, gaze following, and antiphonal calling. Many of these behaviors are likely to be disrupted by developmental brain malformations like CCD. In a pilot study, we investigated marmosets spontaneously born with a small CC (hypoplasia) using rsFMRI to understand cortical connectivity. We discovered that some brain areas are desynchronized, although maintaining direct cortical connectivity. To expand this study to a large marmoset population, it would be important to be able to detect, delineate, and quantify the CC in marmoset monkeys. Furthermore, this methodology could be later expanded to human subjects and could be the basis for a larger framework to perform automatic morphometry in clinical routine. This project proposes to take advantage of this dataset, which is readily available, to train a machine-learning model that would be capable of detecting abnormalities in the CC of marmoset monkeys. We would utilise the high-performance computing tools available at INSIGNEO, such as the ambernectar and threadbeast HPCs to train and test the model with TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework. In order to perform the classification task we will select a ResNet model that has already been pre-trained and fine-tune it to our dataset.
