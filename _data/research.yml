- title: "Selective pruning and neuronal death generate scale-invariant neuronal networks"
  image: paper1.png
  description: From the proliferative mechanisms that generate neurons from a seed population of progenitor cells, through neuron migration and the formation of synaptic connections, several vicissitudes culminate in the formation of a functional mature brain. Component loss, just as gain, remains ubiquitous throughout and can be substantial in scale. For instance, over healthy development, rodent brains lose over half the number of their original neuronal cells and synapses. However, the role of deleterious steps in network ontology (adaptive or otherwise) remains elusive. On the grounds of parsimony alone, it is unlikely that such a costly process would play no role in refining brain network architecture, or that the pruned components are lost at random. Like in the case of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, we expect the processes of synaptic and neuron pruning to also have been shaped by evolution to enable complex and efficient computations. Inspired by the evident necessity of incorporating both component loss and gain in any complete description of a real neuronal network, we propose here a simple algorithm in which a directed network evolves through the selective deletion of less-connected nodes ('neurons') and edges ('synapses'). We show that the resulting networks robustly and without fine-tuning display scale-invariant degree distributions, as long as the network is predominantly feed-forward in nature. Scale-invariance has several properties that are desirable in biological networks, they are by construction scalable, resistant to damage by random deletions, and strongly connected while parsimonious in wiring. Although our algorithm is not meant to be a realistic model for the formation of biological neuronal networks, our results strongly suggest that neuronal and synaptic losses during development are selective rather than random and that selective deletion is an adaptive mechanism that plays a role in producing efficiently structured networks. Finally, despite being inspired by biology, our results have implications for network science more broadly. Scale invariance in degree distributions was first demonstrated for growing preferential attachment networks and then shown empirically to be present in a broad range of contexts. Our algorithm for preferential detachment provides an alternative mechanism for generating such networks, indicating perhaps that both preferential attachment and detachment are part of a broader class of algorithms that result in scale-free networks.

- title: "Performance correlates in an in silico animat"
  image: paper3.png
  description: Brain size varies by more than 100.000-fold across species and it was considered a proxy for the number of brain neurons across and within species. However, the latest studies point to brain mass and neuronal numbers scaling differently across species whilst the number of other cells follows an almost universal scaling rule. Inside the same species, brain mass and neuronal numbers were found to not correlate at all. It has been postulated that neuronal numbers in the cerebral cortex are the neuroanatomical determinants of cognitive abilities across species - the more neurons, the more information processing capacity. Conversely, it is not clear whether this relationship holds within a species, most likely because the magnitude of difference in neuronal numbers needed to elicit the cognitive difference across species remains not present. Moreover, which specific neuronal correlates would explain that difference is currently unknown. Computational neuroscience provides us with a framework for neuronal simulation that has been greatly expanded in levels of detail in the past decades. Nevertheless, simulating complex behavioural tasks with these tools was not greatly explored due to the lack of embodiment of the simulated neuronal networks. In this work, a previously unpublished bespoke platform to connect cultured neuronal networks to a mobile robot is used to assemble a virtual animal, an animat. This set-up will be conditioned to perform behavioural tasks after being connected to a simulated neuronal network created utilising BRIAN2, which in recent updates also offers the possibility to accurately simulate glial cells. Multiple neuronal numbers, neuron-to-glia ratios and network configurations will be tested in terms of the animat performance in progressively complex tasks from simple obstacle avoidance to maze navigation. Network topology is simulated in a way that closely resembles the layout of multi-electrode arrays which allows for complex network properties to be tested and simulated as in its in vitro counterparts. It is expected that performance differences between the simulated networks will appear when the divergence in neuronal numbers surpasses the 1.63-fold found intra-species in mice.

- title: "3D modelling of axonal guidance"
  image: paper4.jpg
  description:  The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest forebrain commissure and mediates the connection between both brain hemispheres. Recent finds published by Szczupak et al. (2022) point to ~75% of interhemispheric callosal connections being heterotopic. This study used mice, marmosets, and humans with data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging. Still, the way the axons orient themselves during cortical development remains elusive. In the project, I aim to generate a 3D model of a cortical region with defined rules for axonal guidance. It will be developed using agent-based modelling, in Python. The model would comprise axons that grow at a similar speed and chemotaxis using signals such as netrin, Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and other guidance cues, secreted by the midline with an anteroposterior temporal gradient. If the axons do not reach the midline they are removed. When they do reach the midline, they attach to others to follow a non-predefined path to the cortex. The model would then be used to test with the current signals found in the literature are sufficient to reproduce Szczupak's results from brain development and if so, which of the variables are the key components to generate the proportion of heterotopic axons found.
