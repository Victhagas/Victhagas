  description: From the proliferative mechanisms that generate neurons from a seed population of progenitor cells, through neuron migration and the formation of synaptic connections, several vicissitudes culminate in the formation of a functional mature brain. Component loss, just as gain, remains ubiquitous throughout and can be substantial in scale. For instance, over healthy development, rodent brains lose over half the number of their original neuronal cells and synapses. However, the role of deleterious steps in network ontology (adaptive or otherwise) remains elusive.  On the grounds of parsimony alone, it is unlikely that such a costly process would play no role in refining brain network architecture, or that the pruned components are lost at random. Like in the case of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, we expect the processes of synaptic and neuron pruning to also have been shaped by evolution to enable complex and efficient computations.

  Inspired by the evident necessity of incorporating both component loss and gain in any complete description of a real neuronal network, we propose here a simple algorithm in which a directed network evolves through the selective deletion of less-connected nodes ('neurons') and edges ('synapses'). We show that the resulting networks robustly and without fine-tuning display scale-invariant degree distributions, as long as the network is predominantly feed-forward in nature.

Scale-invariance has several properties that are desirable in biological networks, they are by construction scalable, resistant to damage by random deletions, and strongly connected while parsimonious in wiring. Although our algorithm is not meant to be a realistic model for the formation of biological neuronal networks, our results strongly suggest that neuronal and synaptic losses during development are selective rather than random and that selective deletion is an adaptive mechanism that plays a role in producing efficiently structured networks.
  
  Finally, despite being inspired by biology, our results have implications for network science more broadly. Scale invariance in degree distributions was first demonstrated for growing preferential attachment networks and then shown empirically to be present in a broad range of contexts. Our algorithm for preferential detachment provides an alternative mechanism for generating such networks, indicating perhaps that both preferential attachment and detachment are part of a broader class of algorithms that result in scale-free networks.
