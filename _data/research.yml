- title: "Selective pruning and neuronal death generate scale-invariant neuronal networks"
  image: paper1.png
  description: From the proliferative mechanisms that generate neurons from a seed population of progenitor cells, through neuron migration and the formation of synaptic connections, several vicissitudes culminate in the formation of a functional mature brain. Component loss, just as gain, remains ubiquitous throughout and can be substantial in scale. For instance, over healthy development, rodent brains lose over half the number of their original neuronal cells and synapses. However, the role of deleterious steps in network ontology (adaptive or otherwise) remains elusive. On the grounds of parsimony alone, it is unlikely that such a costly process would play no role in refining brain network architecture, or that the pruned components are lost at random. Like in the case of neurogenesis and synaptogenesis, we expect the processes of synaptic and neuron pruning to also have been shaped by evolution to enable complex and efficient computations. Inspired by the evident necessity of incorporating both component loss and gain in any complete description of a real neuronal network, we propose here a simple algorithm in which a directed network evolves through the selective deletion of less-connected nodes ('neurons') and edges ('synapses'). We show that the resulting networks robustly and without fine-tuning display scale-invariant degree distributions, as long as the network is predominantly feed-forward in nature. Scale-invariance has several properties that are desirable in biological networks, they are by construction scalable, resistant to damage by random deletions, and strongly connected while parsimonious in wiring. Although our algorithm is not meant to be a realistic model for the formation of biological neuronal networks, our results strongly suggest that neuronal and synaptic losses during development are selective rather than random and that selective deletion is an adaptive mechanism that plays a role in producing efficiently structured networks. Finally, despite being inspired by biology, our results have implications for network science more broadly. Scale invariance in degree distributions was first demonstrated for growing preferential attachment networks and then shown empirically to be present in a broad range of contexts. Our algorithm for preferential detachment provides an alternative mechanism for generating such networks, indicating perhaps that both preferential attachment and detachment are part of a broader class of algorithms that result in scale-free networks.

- title: "An intelligent classificator for the diagnosis of dysgenesis"
  image: paper2.jpeg
  description: Corpus Callosum Dysgenesis (CCD) is a congenital developmental malformation of the corpus callosum (CC) often associated with several comorbidities. Callosal malformations vary extensively in their presentation, from hypoplasic and partial formations to complete agenesis. Regardless of the degree of callosal malformations, reorganization of the CCD brain can generate new aberrant white matter fibre bundles, leading to widespread structural and functional changes affecting the entire brain. For example, hypoplasic CCD subjects and mouse models have an atypical structural brain connectivity profile that is substantially different from that of healthy subjects. To better understand how CCD brains can rewire to compensate for callosal deficits and process interhemispheric information, animal models are needed to allow more invasive studies aiming to describe axonal plasticity. Many genetically modified mice lines have been described to feature CCD, but most do not survive until adult age. In addition, they do not present hypoplasia or partial CCD, only complete agenesis. Other spontaneous mouse strains, such as the Balb/c, can produce different CCD phenotypes and fill the void. However, accessing cognitive behavior in mice is challenging. Because they are phylogenetically closer to humans and exhibit complex cognitive functions and social behavior, non-human primates are the ideal model of CCD. One great example is the common marmoset, a highly social non-human primate that has several practical advantages in biomedical research, such as small size, easy adaptation to life in captivity, no zoonotic transmission, and prolific breeding. Marmosets exhibit a highly sophisticated repertoire of social behavior, including cooperative rearing of infants, foraging for food and vigilance against predators, social grooming, scent-marking behavior, gaze following, and antiphonal calling. Many of these behaviors are likely to be disrupted by developmental brain malformations like CCD. In a pilot study, we investigated marmosets spontaneously born with a small CC (hypoplasia) using rsFMRI to understand cortical connectivity. We discovered that some brain areas are desynchronized, although maintaining direct cortical connectivity. To expand this study to a large marmoset population, it would be important to be able to detect, delineate, and quantify the CC in marmoset monkeys. Furthermore, this methodology could be later expanded to human subjects and could be the basis for a larger framework to perform automatic morphometry in clinical routine. This project proposes to take advantage of this dataset, which is readily available, to train a machine-learning model that would be capable of detecting abnormalities in the CC of marmoset monkeys. We would utilise the high-performance computing tools available at INSIGNEO, such as the ambernectar and threadbeast HPCs to train and test the model with TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework. In order to perform the classification task we will select a ResNet model that has already been pre-trained and fine-tune it to our dataset.

- title: "An intelligent classificator for the diagnosis of ALSP"
  image: paper3.png
  description: ALSP is an infrequent condition of uncertain global prevalence and lacks a current treatment. The disease primarily manifests as the degeneration of white matter in the frontal and parietal lobes as well as the corpus callosum, while sparing the temporal lobes. ALSP presents a diverse array of symptoms across various domains, including cognitive decline with executive dysfunction, psychiatric manifestations like depression, and motor deficits. This broad spectrum of nonspecific symptoms poses challenges for accurate ALSP diagnosis, often leading to misidentification as other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease or Multiple Sclerosis. The Touchscreen Operant Platform is specifically crafted to evaluate diverse aspects of executive function, encompassing cognitive flexibility and attention. Its operational methods and task designs make it adaptable for use in both human subjects and experimental models. Meanwhile, the Rodent Continuous Performance Task enables researchers to evaluate different cognitive elements, such as sustained attention, selective attention, reaction time, and impulse control. The mouse CPT provides a range of task probes and allows customization of task parameters to adjust the attentional load. This pipeline serves as a diagnostic tool utilizing CPT data. Both the Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms utilize different performance metrics from the task to predict the genotype of each animal, distinguishing between animals that are wild type (with no discernible phenotype) and those that are heterozygous for a crucial gene associated with the ALSP phenotype. The primary objective of this code is to fine-tune models using grid search with cross-validation, conduct feature selection, and assess the models' performance using accuracy metrics. The iterative feature removal process aims to refine model accuracy.

- title: "Performance correlates in an in silico animat"
  image: paper3.png
  description: Brain size varies by more than 100.000-fold across species and it was considered a proxy for the number of brain neurons across and within species. However, the latest studies point to brain mass and neuronal numbers scaling differently across species whilst the number of other cells follows an almost universal scaling rule. Inside the same species, brain mass and neuronal numbers were found to not correlate at all. It has been postulated that neuronal numbers in the cerebral cortex are the neuroanatomical determinants of cognitive abilities across species - the more neurons, the more information processing capacity. Conversely, it is not clear whether this relationship holds within a species, most likely because the magnitude of difference in neuronal numbers needed to elicit the cognitive difference across species remains not present. Moreover, which specific neuronal correlates would explain that difference is currently unknown. Computational neuroscience provides us with a framework for neuronal simulation that has been greatly expanded in levels of detail in the past decades. Nevertheless, simulating complex behavioural tasks with these tools was not greatly explored due to the lack of embodiment of the simulated neuronal networks. In this work, a previously unpublished bespoke platform to connect cultured neuronal networks to a mobile robot is used to assemble a virtual animal, an animat. This set-up will be conditioned to perform behavioural tasks after being connected to a simulated neuronal network created utilising BRIAN2, which in recent updates also offers the possibility to accurately simulate glial cells. Multiple neuronal numbers, neuron-to-glia ratios and network configurations will be tested in terms of the animat performance in progressively complex tasks from simple obstacle avoidance to maze navigation. Network topology is simulated in a way that closely resembles the layout of multi-electrode arrays which allows for complex network properties to be tested and simulated as in its in vitro counterparts. It is expected that performance differences between the simulated networks will appear when the divergence in neuronal numbers surpasses the 1.63-fold found intra-species in mice.

- title: "3D modelling of axonal guidance"
  image: paper4.jpg
  description:  The corpus callosum (CC) is the largest forebrain commissure and mediates the connection between both brain hemispheres. Recent finds published by Szczupak et al. (2022) point to ~75% of interhemispheric callosal connections being heterotopic. This study used mice, marmosets, and humans with data from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas and high-resolution diffusion-weighted imaging. Still, the way the axons orient themselves during cortical development remains elusive. In the project, I aim to generate a 3D model of a cortical region with defined rules for axonal guidance. It will be developed using agent-based modelling, in Python. The model would comprise axons that grow at a similar speed and chemotaxis using signals such as netrin, Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and other guidance cues, secreted by the midline with an anteroposterior temporal gradient. If the axons do not reach the midline they are removed. When they do reach the midline, they attach to others to follow a non-predefined path to the cortex. The model would then be used to test with the current signals found in the literature are sufficient to reproduce Szczupak's results from brain development and if so, which of the variables are the key components to generate the proportion of heterotopic axons found.
